      At the heart of engineering, lies the realm of problem-solving. As
      aspiring engineers, it is important for us to learn to practically apply
      concepts of engineering in solving real-life problems. As a part of our
      assignment, our group was assigned to look for ‘pains’ in the ‘C’ section
      of the Memorial Union. After looking for a long time, our team was finally
      able to find a big problem. I noticed that most people sitting in the
      lounge were keeping laptops on their laps. Previously, I had read an
      article on how keeping laptops on our laps is very harmful for our skin.
      Following up from that article, I knew that keeping laptops on our laps
      for prolonged periods of time could cause the ‘toasted skin syndrome’ and
      could potentially lead to skin cancer in some cases.

      However, this was not the only problem. Those who had access to tables
      were struggling with the height differences between the chairs and the
      tables. This could lead to back problems and tension in the spinal region,
      which only takes us to all other sorts of issues. By engineering a new and
      innovative solution for tables, we could solve two problems at once. There
      is no table that can be right for everyone so we started looking for
      adjustable solutions.

      I think that a good solution to these problems is an attached foldable
      table which could be opened from both the armrests on the chair. Its
      height could be adjusted easily and it would prevent students from causing
      harm to their skin. Another good feature of this solution is
      space-efficiency. By attaching these foldable tables, we could save a lot
      of space in any given room. This solution also does not require any kind
      of advanced and expensive technology. It instead relies on the concepts of
      space efficiency and accessible design. It is simple in every way and is
      also cheaper to build. I believe that a good solution should be effective,
      efficient, accessible, and affordable. The foldable tables do fulfil all
      these requirements which is why I chose to continue with this idea.
